The planned architecture consists of the following components:

1. **Admin Panel Web Interface**:

   - A user-friendly interface for administrators to configure and manage the system.

2. **Importapi**:

   - A service for importing and extracting text from various sources (e.g., txt, pdf, docx, URLs).

3. **Vector Database**:

   - A storage solution optimized for vector representations of knowledge base content.

4. **LLM (Large Language Model)**:

   - Provides natural language processing capabilities for querying and interacting with the knowledge base.

5. **Chat bot**:

   - A user-facing chat window for interacting with the assistant.
